# LightsOnSolver
Solution finder for Lights On puzzle game

In the Lights On puzzle game you need to turn on all lights in a grid using a number of light switches. Each switch is connected to a number of lights, and if a light is
already turned on, it will turn it off. Otherwise it will turn it on.

A light can have multiple switches connected to it. You need to find a combination of switches where all the lights are turned on.

To use this solver just provide the initial state of the lights in the ./InputFiles/InitialState.txt file, and provide which lights the different switches affect in the
./InputFiles/Switches.txt file. Both files contain an example that shows the format.
